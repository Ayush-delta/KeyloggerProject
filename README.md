# KeyloggerProject
This project implements a Python-based keylogger client and a Flask server to capture, process, and store keystrokes as words. The keylogger buffers keystrokes, processes them into words (handling backspaces and special keys), and saves them locally in JSON and text formats while sending them to a Flask server for further processing and storage.
